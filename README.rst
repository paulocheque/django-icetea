Django-IceTea
==================
``django-icetea`` is a package built on top of ``Django``, which lays the
foundation for easily creating REST APIs.

It is heavily influenced by ``django-piston`` and
``piston-perfect``. ``piston-perfect`` was built on top of ``django-piston``,
and the combination of the two, was actually a very stable package. However,
the code used a lot of ugly hacks, which made it quite incomprehensible, and not very easy to tweak.

For these reasons, I've decided to build ``django-icetea``. It is slim,
readable and easy to use. Main focus is stability and maintainability.

Enjoy!!
