Django-IceTea
==================

``django-icetea`` is a package built on top of `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ and provides the necessary abstractions for creating REST APIs.

It has been influenced by the architecture of `django-piston
<https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/wiki/Home>`_ and
`piston-perfect <https://github.com/smartpr/piston-perfect>`_. The combination of these 2 packages is actually a very stable
API infrastructure. However their code could, in my opinion at least, be way
more clear and maintainable.

For this reason, I've decided to build ``django-icetea``. It is slim, readable
and easy to use, with its main focus being stability and maintainability.

Enjoy!!
